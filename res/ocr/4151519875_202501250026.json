This safety net was created by Mississippi law, which \ndetermines who and what is covered and the amounts of coverage.\nThe Association was established to provide protection in the unlikely event that your life, annuity or health insurer \nbecomes financially unable to meet its obligations. If this should happen, the Association will typically arrange to continue \ncoverage and pay claims, in accordance with Mississippi law, with funding from assessments paid by other insurance \ncompanies. (For purposes of this notice, the terms \u201cinsurance company\u201d and \u201cinsurer\u201d include health maintenance \norganizations (HMOs).)\nThe basic protections provided by the Association are:\nLife Insurance\n\u00b7 $300,000 in death benefits\n\u00b7 $100,000 in net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values\nHealth Insurance\n\u00b7 $500,000 for health benefit plans (see definition below)\n\u00b7 $300,000 in disability income insurance benefits\n\u00b7 $300,000 in long-term care insurance benefits\n\u00b7 $100,000 in other types of health insurance benefits\nAnnuities\n\u00b7 $250,000 in the present value of annuity benefits, including net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal \nvalues\nThe maximum amount of protection for each individual, regardless of the number of policies or contracts, is $300,000. \nSpecial rules may apply with regard to health benefit plans.\n\u201cHealth benefit plan\u201d is defined in Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 83-23-209 and generally includes hospital or medical expense \npolicies, contracts or certificates, or HMO subscriber contracts that provide comprehensive forms of coverage for \nhospitalization or medical services, but excludes policies that provide coverages for limited benefits (such as dental-only \nor vision-only insurance), Medicare Supplement insurance, disability income insurance and long-term care insurance \n(LTCI).\nNote: Certain policies and contracts may not be covered or fully covered. For example, coverage does not extend to \nany portion(s) of a policy or contract that the insurer does not guarantee, such as certain investment additions to the \naccount value of a variable life insurance policy or a variable annuity contract. There are also various residency \nrequirements and other limitations under Mississippi law.\nBenefits provided by a long-term care (LTC) rider to a life insurance policy or annuity contract shall be considered the \nsame type of benefits as the base life insurance policy or annuity contract to which it relates.\nTo learn more about the above protections, limitations and exclusions, as well as protections relating to group contracts or \nretirement plans, please visit the Association's website at www.mslifega.org, or contact:\nMississippi Life and Health Insurance Mississippi Insurance Department\nGuaranty Association Woolfolk Building\n330 North Mart Plaza 501 N.
